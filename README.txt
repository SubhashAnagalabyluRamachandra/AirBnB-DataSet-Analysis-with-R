##AirBnB Dataset Analysis

##Summary
This project aims to analyze the Airbnb data of newly registered listers to identify the key factors that contribute to becoming a Super Host. 
Utilizing data visualization, statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to understand the correlation between multiple attributes 
present in the dataset and conclude that review score is one of the main factors for attaining the Super Host status. By analyzing the data, we found 
that the longer the listing is on the platform, the higher the probability of getting positive reviews and if the listed property is present on the 
platform for more than 200 days, the plausibility of getting positive reviews increases. This project will help in understanding the most probable 
ways of becoming a Super Host and the factors that could impact the lister to mislay the status.
